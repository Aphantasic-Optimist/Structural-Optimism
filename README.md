# Structural Optimism

An evidence-based philosophical proof that reality is structured toward integration.

## The Proof

**Three facts:**
1. Social connection reduces mortality by 50% (2.2M people studied)
2. Romantic love found in 166 of 166 cultures studied
3. Reality is structured toward integration — we experience integration as love

**The universe is shaped like optimism.**

## What is Structural Optimism?

We are not naive optimists (believing the universe has a plan for us).  
We are not nihilists (despairing at meaninglessness).  
We are **structural optimists** (recognizing reality is shaped toward integration).

**What we accept:** Life has no cosmic meaning. The universe is indifferent. We will die. Suffering exists.

**What we observe:** Reality is STRUCTURED toward integration. Integration creates consciousness. Love IS integration.

**What we choose:** Align with reality's structure. Love actively. Create meaning through choices.

This is optimism grounded in the architecture of existence, not faith.
