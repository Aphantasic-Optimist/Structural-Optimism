# Structural Optimism

An evidence-based philosophical proof that reality is structured toward integration.

## Overview

This website presents the Structural Optimism framework through a 5-level content pyramid, from simple proofs accessible to everyone to academic-level philosophical arguments.

**The Simplest Proof:**
1. Social connection reduces mortality risk by 50% (2.2M people studied)
2. Romantic love found in 166 cultures (vast majority of cultures studied)
3. Reality is structured toward integration - we experience integration as love

## What is Structural Optimism?

We are not naive optimists (believing the universe has a plan for us).  
We are not nihilists (despairing at meaninglessness).  
We are structural optimists (recognizing reality is shaped toward integration).

**What we accept:**
- Life has no cosmic meaning
- The universe is indifferent to human concerns
- We will die
- Suffering exists

**What we observe:**
- Reality is STRUCTURED toward integration
- Integration creates consciousness
- Love IS integration
- Humans across ALL cultures consistently report this

**What we choose:**
- To align with reality's structure (integration)
- To love actively (integration)
- To create meaning through choices (integration)
- To find joy in alignment with how reality works

This is optimism grounded in the architecture of existence, not faith.

## Content Levels

- **Level 1 - Simple**: The core proof in three facts
- **Level 2 - Intermediate**: Evidence and the ME AND WE principle
- **Level 3 - Advanced**: Mechanisms and practical applications
- **Level 4 - Analysis**: Cultural and political analysis
- **Level 5 - Academic**: Complete philosophical proof and citations

## Building the Site

This site is built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

**Note**: This project uses a Python virtual environment (venv) for dependency management.

```bash
# Create virtual environment (if not already created)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Important**: Always activate the virtual environment before running MkDocs commands.

### Local Development

```bash
# Serve locally with live reload
mkdocs serve

# Build static site
mkdocs build

# Validate all links
mkdocs build --strict
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch.

**First-time setup:**
1. See [GITHUB-PAGES-SETUP.md](GITHUB-PAGES-SETUP.md) for detailed configuration instructions
2. Use [DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md) to verify successful deployment

**Automatic deployment:**
- Push to `main` branch triggers automatic build and deployment
- Workflow typically completes in 2-3 minutes
- Monitor deployment status in the **Actions** tab

**Manual deployment:**
- Go to **Actions** → **Deploy MkDocs to GitHub Pages**
- Click **Run workflow** → Select **main** branch → **Run workflow**
