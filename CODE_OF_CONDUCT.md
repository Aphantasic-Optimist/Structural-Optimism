## Philosophy

This project is built on structural optimism: the recognition that reality is structured toward integration. We extend this principle to our community:

- **Integration WITH differentiation**: We welcome diverse perspectives while maintaining shared standards
- **Evidence-based discourse**: We ground discussions in verifiable facts and sources
- **Compassionate rigor**: We maintain high standards while treating each other with kindness
- **ME AND WE**: We honor individual contributions while building collective knowledge

**Everyone lives happily ever after.** ✨
