## 1. CTRA - Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity

**Confidence:** ★★★★☆

**Researcher:** Steve Cole, UCLA

**Finding:** Loneliness triggers inflammatory gene expression

### Evidence

| Study | Sample | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Cole et al. 2007 | 14 | 209 differentially expressed genes in lonely individuals |
| Cole et al. 2015 | 108 | Eudaimonic wellbeing downregulates CTRA |

### Mechanism
- Lonely individuals show upregulation of 78 inflammation genes (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF)
- Downregulation of 131 antiviral/antibody genes
- Effect independent of social network size, age, health

### Implications
- Explains elevated disease risk in lonely individuals
- Provides molecular target for interventions
- Shows loneliness is literally "under the skin"

## 2. Oxytocin Cardiovascular Protection

**Confidence:** ★★★★☆

**Researchers:** Light, Grewen, Uvnäs-Moberg

**Finding:** Oxytocin reduces blood pressure and stress reactivity

### Evidence

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Light et al. 2005 | Hugs → higher oxytocin → lower BP during stress |
| Grewen et al. 2011 | Higher oxytocin → vasodilation, lower norepinephrine |

### Mechanism
- Physical touch releases oxytocin
- Oxytocin acts on cardiac/vascular receptors
- Reduces sympathetic activation
- Promotes vasodilation

### Effect Sizes
- Correlations r = -0.22 to -0.28 (modest but consistent)

## 3. HPA Axis Stress Buffering

**Confidence:** ★★★★★

**Researchers:** Cohen & Wills (foundational), Heinrichs

**Finding:** Social support dampens cortisol stress response

### Evidence

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Cohen & Wills 1985 | Established stress-buffering model |
| Heinrichs et al. 2003 | Social support + oxytocin reduces cortisol |

### Mechanism
- Social support activates oxytocin and opioid systems
- These inhibit HPA axis activation
- Result: lower cortisol response to stressors
- Effect strongest when stress is high

### Key Insight
- Buffering effect depends on relationship quality
- Attachment security moderates the effect

## 4. Inter-Brain Synchrony

**Confidence:** ★★★★☆

**Researchers:** Uri Hasson (Princeton), Suzanne Dikker (NYU)

**Finding:** Brains synchronize during social connection

### Evidence

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Hasson (multiple) | Speaker-listener neural coupling predicts comprehension |
| Dikker (multiple) | Team synchrony predicts collective performance |
| Bilek et al. 2022 | Directed connectivity in TPJ during joint attention |

### Brain Regions
- Prefrontal cortex (PFC)
- Temporo-parietal junction (TPJ)
- Superior temporal gyrus
- Mirror neuron system

### Key Finding
- Reciprocal cooperation produces GREATER synchrony than individual tasks
- Physical presence enhances effect (vs virtual)

## Summary: The Biological Case

```
Social Connection
       ↓
┌──────┴──────┐
↓             ↓
Oxytocin    Lower CTRA
   ↓           ↓
Lower BP    Less inflammation
   ↓           ↓
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
  Lower Mortality
```

**All four mechanisms converge:** Social connection → biological changes → health outcomes
