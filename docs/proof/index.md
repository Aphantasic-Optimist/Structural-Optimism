## The Core Argument

### Three Facts

**Fact 1:** Reality is structured so that complex things emerge when simple things cooperate.
- Atoms → molecules → cells → organisms → societies → consciousness

**Fact 2:** Humans die without connection.
- 2.2 million people studied: social isolation increases mortality by 32%

**Fact 3:** We experience connection as good.
- Love feels good. Belonging feels good. This is universal across all cultures.

### One Conclusion

**Reality is structured so that what helps us survive (connection) is what we experience as good (love).**

**The universe is shaped like optimism.**
