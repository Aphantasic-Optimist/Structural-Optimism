## What This Proves

**Not:** The universe loves us  
**Not:** Everything happens for a reason  
**Not:** Just think positive

**But:** Reality has a structure. That structure favors integration. We experience integration as love. Aligning with this structure helps us flourish.

**This is observation, not faith.**
