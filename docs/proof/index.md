## The Core Argument

1. **Reality is structured toward integration** - Complexity emerges through cooperation
2. **Humans experience integration as good** - Love, connection, belonging feel good
3. **Integration enables survival** - 2.2M people studied: connection = longer life
4. **Therefore:** Reality is structured toward what we experience as good

**This is structural optimism.**
