# L0-L5 Consciousness Framework

!!! info "Confidence: ★★☆☆☆ Preliminary"
    This is a **theoretical framework** under development. It is NOT established science.

---

## What This Is

A layered model proposing that consciousness emerges through progressive integration across six levels:

| Level | Name | Description | Confidence |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| **L0** | Zero-Point Field | Quantum vacuum substrate | ★☆☆☆☆ Speculative |
| **L0.5** | Quantum-Classical Interface | Bridge between quantum and classical | ★☆☆☆☆ Speculative |
| **L1** | Biological Transduction | Quantum effects in biology | ★★★★☆ Strong |
| **L2** | Neural Processing | Brain computation | ★★★★★ Established |
| **L3** | Cognitive Integration | Binding and attention | ★★★★☆ Strong |
| **L4** | Social Synchrony | Interpersonal connection | ★★★★★ Established |
| **L5** | Phenomenal Experience | Subjective qualia | ★★☆☆☆ Preliminary |

---

## The Core Idea

Consciousness isn't a single phenomenon but a **stack of integrations**:

1. Quantum processes integrate at L0-L0.5
2. Biology transduces these into cellular signals at L1
3. Neurons process and bind information at L2-L3
4. Social connection extends integration beyond individuals at L4
5. Subjective experience emerges from this integrated whole at L5

**Key claim:** Each level exhibits the same pattern—integration creates complexity and enables the next level.

## What's Established vs Speculative

### ✅ Established (★★★★+)

- **L1 Quantum Biology:** Cryptochrome magnetoreception in birds (Ritz 2000, Hore 2016, Xu 2021), quantum coherence in photosynthesis (Engel 2007, replicated)
- **L2 Neural Processing:** Standard neuroscience
- **L4 Social Connection:** Holt-Lunstad meta-analysis (2.2M people), universal love across 166 cultures

### ⚠️ Preliminary (★★☆☆☆)

- **L3 Cognitive Integration:** IIT's Φ measure shows promise but key predictions failed (Cogitate 2025)
- **L5 Phenomenal Experience:** We know it exists, mechanism unclear

### 🔮 Speculative (★☆☆☆☆)

- **L0 Zero-Point Field:** No direct evidence for consciousness connection
- **L0.5 Quantum-Classical Interface:** Theoretical only, no experimental confirmation in neural tissue

---

## What Would Disprove This

The framework would be falsified if:

1. **L0.5 is impossible** — If quantum effects cannot persist long enough in warm, wet neural tissue to be functionally relevant
2. **Consciousness is fully classical** — If a complete explanation of consciousness requires no quantum effects
3. **Integration doesn't scale** — If the pattern of "integration creates complexity" breaks down at some level
4. **L1 quantum biology is artifact** — If cryptochrome and photosynthesis coherence are shown to be measurement artifacts

---

## Open Questions

| Question | Status | What Would Answer It |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Does quantum coherence exist in neural tissue? | Unknown | In vivo measurements (Google Research Awards 2025 funding this) |
| What is the decoherence timescale in neurons? | Unknown | Direct measurement |
| How does L0.5 bridge quantum to classical? | Speculative | Theoretical breakthrough + experimental confirmation |
| Is Φ (integrated information) the right measure? | Uncertain | Cogitate 2025 results suggest problems |

## Relationship to Structural Optimism

This framework attempts to explain **why** structural optimism is true:

- **Core claim:** Reality is structured toward integration
- **L0-L5 hypothesis:** This structure exists at every level, from quantum to social

If the framework is wrong, the core claim still stands—it's based on epidemiological evidence, not this theory.

If the framework is right, it explains the mechanism behind the pattern.
