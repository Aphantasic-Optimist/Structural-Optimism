# Theoretical Explorations

!!! warning "Not Established Science"
    The theories in this section are **speculative frameworks** being developed alongside our evidence-based core claims.
    
    They are included for transparency, not as proven facts.

---

## Why Include Speculative Work?

Science progresses through **hypothesis → test → refine**.

We share our theoretical explorations because:

1. **Transparency** — You see our full thinking, not just polished conclusions
2. **Falsifiability** — Each theory has clear criteria for what would disprove it
3. **Collaboration** — Others can critique, improve, or test these ideas
4. **Honesty** — We don't pretend to have all the answers

## How to Read These Pages

Every exploration includes:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Confidence Rating** | ★☆☆☆☆ to ★★★☆☆ (never ★★★★★ here) |
| **What This Is** | Clear description of the theory |
| **What Would Disprove This** | Falsification criteria |
| **Evidence Status** | Which parts are grounded vs speculative |
| **Open Questions** | What we don't know |

## Current Explorations

### Consciousness Frameworks

| Theory | Confidence | Status | Description |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------|
| [L0-L5 Framework](l0-l5-framework.md) | ★★☆☆☆ | Preliminary | Layered model from quantum substrate to phenomenal experience |
| [Quantum-Classical Interface](quantum-classical-interface.md) | ★☆☆☆☆ | Speculative | The hypothetical L0.5 bridge between quantum and classical |
| [Emotional Integration Theory](emotional-integration-theory.md) | ★★☆☆☆ | Preliminary | How emotions may relate to integration dynamics |

### Related Established Theories

| Theory | Confidence | Status | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| [Integrated Information Theory](../theories/integrated-information-theory.md) | ★☆☆☆☆ | Tested | Key predictions failed in Cogitate 2025 |
| [Global Workspace Theory](../theories/global-workspace-theory.md) | ★★☆☆☆ | Tested | Some predictions failed in Cogitate 2025 |

## The Difference: Core Claims vs Explorations

| Aspect | Core Claims | Explorations |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Confidence** | ★★★★☆ to ★★★★★ | ★☆☆☆☆ to ★★★☆☆ |
| **Evidence** | Peer-reviewed, replicated | Theoretical, preliminary |
| **Status** | Established or strong | Speculative or preliminary |
| **Purpose** | What we know | What we're exploring |

**Our core claims** (social connection reduces mortality, love is universal) are backed by massive epidemiological studies involving millions of people.

**Our explorations** are theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain *why* these patterns exist at a deeper level. They may be wrong. That's okay—that's how science works.

## Confidence Rating Guide

| Rating | Meaning | Evidence Required |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Speculative | Theoretical only, no direct evidence |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Preliminary | Some supporting evidence, not replicated |
| ★★★☆☆ | Promising | Multiple studies, awaiting replication |

!!! note "Why nothing higher?"
    Theories rated ★★★★☆ or ★★★★★ belong in the main Claims section, not here. If an exploration reaches that level of evidence, we move it.

## How These Relate to Structural Optimism

The core proof of structural optimism stands on its own:

- Reality is structured toward integration ✅
- Social connection reduces mortality ✅  
- Love is universal across cultures ✅

The explorations ask: **Why?**

- Why does integration create complexity?
- What is the mechanism connecting quantum physics to consciousness?
- How does subjective experience emerge from physical processes?

These are fascinating questions. We have hypotheses. We don't have proof.
