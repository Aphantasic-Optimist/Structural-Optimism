# Evidence for Structural Optimism

This page presents the scientific evidence supporting structural optimism.

## Social Connection Research

Large-scale studies show that social connection is fundamental to human wellbeing:

- **2.2 million people** studied across mortality research
- **89,000 people** in religious community studies
- **166 cultures** showing consistent patterns of romantic love

## Integration in Nature

Evidence from multiple scientific fields demonstrates that reality tends toward integration:

- Biological systems self-organize into complex structures
- Social systems naturally form cooperative networks
- Physical systems evolve toward higher complexity

## What This Means

The evidence consistently points to a universe structured toward connection and integration, not isolation and dissolution.
