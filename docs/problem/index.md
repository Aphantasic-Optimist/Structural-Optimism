# The Problem

**Devices became vices. Division became profitable. We forgot about "we."**

---

## We've All Been There

Let's be honest: we've all gotten lost in our screens.

Scrolling through meals. Missing the person across the table. Comparing our lives to curated highlights. Chasing metrics that don't actually matter.

**This isn't a character flaw.** It's what happens when you navigate alone in a system designed to capture your attention.

The billionaire in his mansion? Lonely. The influencer with millions of followers? Lonely. Someone scrolling late at night looking for something real? Lonely. Meanwhile, the poorest communities often report the highest life satisfaction—because they still have each other.

We've been doing what individuals do: optimizing for personal success. But you can't optimize for the whole earth by yourself. That's not how systems work.

**The problem isn't you. The problem is a system that profits from isolation.**

---

## The Short Version

We built machines that extract attention and sell it.

These machines profit from division. Outrage engages. Fear clicks. Anger shares.

Connection doesn't produce data. Love doesn't generate ad revenue.

**So the machines optimized for the opposite.**

## The Three Problems

### [The Extraction Economy](extraction-economy.md)
Your attention is the product. You are being mined.

Every scroll, click, and pause is captured and sold. The "free" services aren't free—you pay with your consciousness.

### [Why Algorithms Fragment Us](algorithms.md)
Algorithms optimize for engagement, not connection.

Engagement is highest when content confirms your beliefs OR outrages you. Never nuance. Never common ground.

### [How We Lost Free Will](free-will.md)
"You're predictable. Resistance is futile."

This is the story extraction tells. If you believe you have no choice, you won't resist. But it's a lie.

## The Evidence

| Problem | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Attention extraction | $500B+ industry |
| Mental health decline | Depression doubled since 2010 |
| Polarization | Filter bubbles documented globally |
| Loneliness epidemic | 50%+ in some populations |

**This is not conspiracy theory. This is documented, peer-reviewed, measurable.**

## The Good News

**The system is unsustainable.**

- Thermodynamically (extraction depletes)
- Biologically (isolation kills)
- Socially (fragmentation destroys cooperation)

**It will transform.** The question is: into what?

---

## The Solution

**Phone down. Eyes up. Smile.**

You don't need to fix the whole system. You just need to stop feeding it your attention and start giving it to each other.
