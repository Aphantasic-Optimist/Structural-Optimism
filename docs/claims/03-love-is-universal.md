## The Claim

> Romantic love is found in the vast majority of human cultures - it's a human universal, not a Western invention.

Love is not arbitrary emotion - it's the human experience of integration.

---

## Primary Evidence

### Cross-Cultural Research

| Study | Cultures | Finding |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Jankowiak & Fischer 1992 | 166 | Romantic love in vast majority |

**Method:** Yale Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) database

**Evidence found:** Love songs, elopement, personal anguish for beloved - even in cultures that prohibit its expression.

---

## What This Means

1. **Not Western invention** - Present across all cultural contexts
2. **Biological basis** - Cross-cultural consistency suggests evolutionary origin
3. **Integration experience** - Love = subjective experience of neural/social integration

---

## Supporting Evidence

### Neuroscience of Love

| Finding | Source | Confidence |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Inter-brain synchrony during connection | Hasson, Dikker | ★★★★☆ |
| Oxytocin release during bonding | Multiple studies | ★★★★★ |
| DMN coupling in close relationships | Multiple studies | ★★★★☆ |

### Religious Community

| Study | Sample | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Li et al. 2016 | 74,534 women | 33% lower mortality with religious attendance |
| VanderWeele et al. 2016 | 89,708 women | 5-fold lower suicide risk |

## Falsification Criteria

This claim would be falsified if:
- Systematic cross-cultural research showed romantic love absent in majority of cultures
- Love was clearly a recent cultural innovation (post-industrial)
- No biological correlates of love were found

**Status:** No falsifying evidence found.

---

## Caveats

- **Expression varies** - How love is expressed differs culturally
- **Prohibition doesn't eliminate** - Even prohibited, love persists
- **Not claiming identical experience** - Universal presence, not identical form
