## What "Alignment" Means

**NOT:**
- Forced conformity
- Loss of individuality
- Naive positivity

**IS:**
- Choosing connection over isolation
- Prioritizing quality relationships
- Contributing to something larger than self
- ME and WE in balance

---

## Falsification Criteria

This claim would be falsified if:
- Isolation consistently produced better outcomes than connection
- Selfishness consistently outperformed cooperation for individual flourishing
- Meaning/purpose showed no health benefits

**Status:** No falsifying evidence found.

---

## Caveats

- **Not all connection is good** - Quality matters (toxic relationships harm)
- **Individual variation** - Optimal social level varies by person
- **Not prescribing specific lifestyle** - Many paths to integration

---

## Relationship to Other Claims

- **Follows from:** [Claim 1](01-integration-creates-complexity.md), [Claim 2](02-social-connection-reduces-mortality.md), [Claim 3](03-love-is-universal.md)
- **This is the "so what"** - The practical implication

---

## The Structural Optimism Conclusion

> The universe is shaped like optimism - not because it loves us, but because integration is how complexity emerges, how consciousness arises, how life flourishes.

Aligning with this structure is the rational choice.
