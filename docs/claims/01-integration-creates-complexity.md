## The Claim

> All higher complexity emerges through cooperative integration of parts.

This is not a tendency - it's the fundamental mechanism by which complexity arises in the universe.

## Falsification Criteria

This claim would be falsified if:
- Higher complexity could emerge WITHOUT integration
- Fragmentation produced greater complexity than integration
- Isolated systems showed more emergent properties than connected ones

**Status:** No falsifying evidence found.

## Notes

This is the most fundamental claim - it's about the structure of reality itself, not just human experience. The other claims follow from this one.
