## The Claim

> Strong social relationships increase survival likelihood by ~50%, comparable to quitting smoking.

This is the most robustly supported claim in the framework, based on massive epidemiological data.

---

## Primary Evidence

### Meta-Analyses

| Study | Sample Size | Finding | Journal |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Holt-Lunstad et al. 2010 | 308,849 | 50% increased survival | PLoS Medicine |
| Wang et al. 2023 | 2.2M | 32% mortality increase from isolation | Nature Human Behaviour |

### Effect Comparisons

| Risk Factor | Mortality Impact |
|-------------|------------------|
| Social isolation | +32% |
| Loneliness | +14% |
| Smoking 15 cigarettes/day | Equivalent to isolation |
| Obesity | Less than isolation |

## Biological Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Evidence | Confidence |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| CTRA (inflammatory genes) | Cole et al. 2007 | ★★★★☆ |
| Oxytocin cardiovascular | Light et al. 2005 | ★★★★☆ |
| HPA axis buffering | Cohen & Wills 1985 | ★★★★★ |
| Inter-brain synchrony | Hasson, Dikker | ★★★★☆ |

## Important Refinement

**Quality > Quantity**

- Only POSITIVE relationships are protective
- Negative/toxic relationships INCREASE mortality risk (29% heart disease, 32% stroke)
- Conflictual marriages worse than being unmarried

## Methodological Caveats

1. **Measurement issues** - Complex assessments most predictive (OR=1.91), binary least (OR=1.19)
2. **Heterogeneity** - Metaregression explained only 6.8% of variance
3. **Potential confounds** - Reverse causation, selection bias possible
4. **Effect may be conservative** - Single-item measures underestimate

---

## Falsification Criteria

This claim would be falsified if:
- Larger meta-analyses showed no relationship or opposite effect
- Controlled interventions showed social connection doesn't improve health
- The effect disappeared when confounds were controlled

**Status:** No falsifying evidence found. Effect replicated globally.

## Cross-Cultural Validity

Confirmed across: US, UK, Japan, Australia, China, diverse nations
