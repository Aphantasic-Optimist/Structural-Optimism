## Content

CLAIM: Dopamine and serotonin have opposing effects on decision-making, learning, and cognitive processing

CONFIDENCE: ★★★★★ (Established - multiple replications, mainstream neuroscience)

ESTABLISHED MECHANISMS:

DOPAMINE (Accelerator):
- Acts as accelerator for reward-seeking behavior
- Signals when outcomes exceed expectations
- Promotes immediate action and approach behavior

SEROTONIN (Brake):
- Functions as brake promoting patience and long-term thinking
- Creates inhibitory "wait" signals
- Promotes learning from punishments

SOURCES:
- Stanford 2024 study (Nature)
- Meta-analytic evidence (PMC12159863)

STATUS: ✅ ESTABLISHED
