## Content

CLAIM: Heart rate variability synchronizes with brain waves through vagal mechanisms

CONFIDENCE: ★★★★☆ (Strong)

HEART-BRAIN COUPLING:
- Cardiac sympathovagal activity initiates functional brain responses
- High-frequency HRV shows stronger coupling with brain oscillations
- Coupling occurs across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands

RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA (RSA):
- Quantifiable index of myelinated vagal activity
- Higher RSA = improved emotion regulation

SOURCES:
- PNAS 2022
- Frontiers Behavioral Neuroscience 2025

STATUS: ★★★★☆ STRONG
