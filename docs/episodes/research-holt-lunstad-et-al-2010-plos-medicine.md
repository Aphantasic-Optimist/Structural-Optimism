## Content


        Holt-Lunstad et al. (2010) conducted a meta-analysis of 148 studies 
        with 308,849 participants. They found that social connection reduces 
        mortality risk by 50% (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.42-1.59). This effect is 
        comparable to smoking cessation and exceeds obesity and physical inactivity.
        The finding has been replicated across multiple populations and cultures.
        This is a ScientificClaim with 5-star confidence, established status.
