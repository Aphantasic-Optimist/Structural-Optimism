## Content

The Cogitate Consortium (2025) conducted a pre-registered adversarial 
        collaboration across 6 labs testing IIT and GWT predictions. Both theories' 
        specific predictions failed: IIT's sustained posterior synchronization and 
        GWT's prefrontal ignition were not observed as predicted. This is a 
        ScientificClaim with 5-star confidence from a multi-lab pre-registered study.
