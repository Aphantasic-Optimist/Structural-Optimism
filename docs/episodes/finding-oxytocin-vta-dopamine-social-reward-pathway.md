## Content

Complete neural mechanism for social connection → dopamine release:

PATHWAY:
Social interaction → Oxytocin release → VTA dopamine neurons → Nucleus accumbens → Reward → Approach behavior → More social interaction (positive feedback loop)

KEY FINDINGS:
- Oxytocin directly modulates dopamine neurons in VTA
- Increases dopamine release in nucleus accumbens
- Social isolation inhibits oxytocin neuron activity

CONFIDENCE: ★★★★☆ (Strong - 4 Tier 1 sources)

IMPLICATIONS: Explains WHY social connection feels rewarding. Validates neural mechanism for structural optimism.
