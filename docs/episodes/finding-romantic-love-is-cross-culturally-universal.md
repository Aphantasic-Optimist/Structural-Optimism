## Content

CLAIM: Romantic love is a near-universal human phenomenon, not a Western invention

CONFIDENCE: ★★★★★ (Established - replicated across multiple methodologies)

KEY EVIDENCE:
- Jankowiak & Fischer 1992: Found romantic love in 147 of 166 cultures (88.5%) using ethnographic evidence
- 2025 study (PMC11836147): 117,293 participants across 175 countries confirmed romantic love valued universally for long-term relationships
- Neuroscience: Consistent dopaminergic activation patterns (VTA, caudate nucleus) across culturally diverse individuals in love

MECHANISM:
- Evolutionary: Romantic love evolved as mammalian courtship attraction system to focus mating energy on preferred partners
- Neural: Activates dopamine reward pathways (same across cultures)
- Biosocial: Universal biological capacity + culturally variable expression

CULTURAL VARIATION:
- Nuclear family systems value romantic love more highly
- Higher female status correlates with romantic love emphasis
- Modernization increases romantic love's cultural importance
- Lower SES individuals value romantic love MORE (commitment device for economic vulnerability)

FALSIFICATION:
- Would be falsified by finding cultures where romantic love is neurologically impossible
- Would be weakened by finding no dopaminergic activation in non-Western populations

SOURCES:
- Jankowiak & Fischer 1992, Ethnology (JSTOR 3773618)
- PMC11836147 (2025 cross-cultural study, 175 countries)
- PMC1764845 (Fisher et al. neuroscience)
