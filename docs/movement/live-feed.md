## Why This Works

Social connection reduces mortality by 50%.

That's 2.2 million people studied (Wang et al. 2023).

Not philosophy. Epidemiology.

**The practice:**
- No app
- No subscription  
- No guru
- Just 3 seconds

## The Irony

Yes, we're using social media to tell you to put down social media.

You can't escape a trap by pretending it doesn't exist.  
You escape by using it against itself.

This is judo. This is Gandhi. This is real.

## Your Turn

<div class="try-it-now" markdown>
  <h2>Try It Once</h2>
  <p>That's the whole ask.</p>
  <p><strong>Phone down. Eyes up. Smile and wave.</strong></p>
  <p>3 seconds. Right now.</p>
</div>

Then tell us what happened. #SmileAndWave
