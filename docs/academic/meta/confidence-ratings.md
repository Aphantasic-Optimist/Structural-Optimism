# Confidence Rating System

How we assess and communicate certainty.

## The Scale

| Rating | Name | Criteria | Can Change? |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| ★★★★★ | Established | Multiple replications, peer-reviewed, mechanism understood | Rarely |
| ★★★★☆ | Strong | Replicated, peer-reviewed, minor gaps | Sometimes |
| ★★★☆☆ | Promising | Peer-reviewed, awaiting replication | Often |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Preliminary | Single study, speculative mechanism | Frequently |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Speculative | Theoretical only, no direct evidence | Very often |

## What Each Level Means

### ★★★★★ Established

**Requirements:**
- Multiple independent replications
- Published in peer-reviewed journals
- Mechanism understood (or multiple converging mechanisms)
- Cross-cultural or cross-context validity
- No serious unaddressed critiques

**Examples in our theory:**
- Social connection reduces mortality (Holt-Lunstad meta-analysis)
- HPA axis stress buffering (Cohen & Wills)

**What would change it:**
- Major methodological flaw discovered
- Large contradicting meta-analysis
- Mechanism shown to be artifact

---

### ★★★★☆ Strong

**Requirements:**
- At least one replication
- Peer-reviewed publication
- Plausible mechanism proposed
- Minor gaps or caveats acknowledged

**Examples in our theory:**
- Love universality (Jankowiak & Fischer)
- CTRA inflammatory response (Cole)
- Oxytocin cardiovascular protection (Light)

**What would change it:**
- Replication failure
- Alternative mechanism shown more likely
- Major confound identified

---

### ★★★☆☆ Promising

**Requirements:**
- Peer-reviewed publication
- Awaiting independent replication
- Mechanism plausible but not confirmed

**Examples in our theory:**
- Xenon isotope anesthesia anomaly (Li et al. 2018)

**What would change it:**
- Successful replication → upgrade to ★★★★☆
- Failed replication → downgrade to ★★☆☆☆

---

### ★★☆☆☆ Preliminary

**Requirements:**
- Single study or preprint
- Mechanism speculative
- Needs substantial further work

**Examples:**
- Most new findings start here

**What would change it:**
- Peer review + replication → upgrade
- Contradicting evidence → downgrade or remove

---

### ★☆☆☆☆ Speculative

**Requirements:**
- Theoretical only
- No direct empirical evidence
- Interesting but unproven

**Examples:**
- L0.5 quantum-classical interface (theoretical spec)

**What would change it:**
- Any empirical support → upgrade
- Shown to be impossible → remove

---

## Rating Changes Over Time

Ratings are NOT permanent. They change as evidence accumulates.

**Upgrade triggers:**
- Successful replication
- Mechanism confirmed
- Cross-cultural validation
- Meta-analysis support

**Downgrade triggers:**
- Failed replication
- Methodological critique
- Contradicting evidence
- Alternative explanation confirmed

## Current Ratings Summary

| Claim | Rating | Last Changed |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Integration creates complexity | ★★★★★ | Initial |
| Social connection → mortality | ★★★★★ | Initial |
| Love is universal | ★★★★☆ | Initial |
| Alignment → flourishing | ★★★★☆ | Initial |

## Honest Uncertainty

**We distinguish:**
- What we KNOW (★★★★★)
- What we're CONFIDENT about (★★★★☆)
- What's PROMISING (★★★☆☆)
- What's PRELIMINARY (★★☆☆☆)
- What's SPECULATIVE (★☆☆☆☆)

**This is not weakness - it's intellectual honesty.**

**Confidence ratings are living assessments, not permanent labels.** ✨
