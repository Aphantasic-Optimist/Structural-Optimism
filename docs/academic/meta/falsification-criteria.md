# Falsification Criteria

What would disprove the theory?

## Core Principle

> A theory that can't be wrong isn't science.

Every claim must have clear conditions under which it would be falsified.

---

## Claim-by-Claim Falsification

### Claim 1: Integration Creates Complexity

**Would be falsified if:**
- Higher complexity emerged WITHOUT integration
- Fragmentation produced greater complexity than integration
- Isolated systems showed more emergent properties than connected ones

**Current status:** No falsifying evidence

---

### Claim 2: Social Connection Reduces Mortality

**Would be falsified if:**
- Larger meta-analyses showed no relationship or opposite effect
- Controlled interventions showed social connection doesn't improve health
- The effect disappeared when all confounds were controlled
- Cross-cultural replication failed

**Current status:** No falsifying evidence. Effect replicated globally.

**Note:** The 50% figure is approximate. The claim would survive if the true effect were 30% or 70%, but not if it were 0% or negative.

### Claim 3: Love is Universal

**Would be falsified if:**
- Systematic cross-cultural research showed romantic love absent in majority of cultures
- Love was clearly a recent cultural innovation (post-industrial)
- No biological correlates of love were found

**Current status:** No falsifying evidence

---

### Claim 4: Alignment Enables Flourishing

**Would be falsified if:**
- Isolation consistently produced better outcomes than connection
- Selfishness consistently outperformed cooperation for individual flourishing
- Meaning/purpose showed no health benefits

**Current status:** No falsifying evidence

---

## What Would NOT Falsify the Theory

- **Individual exceptions** - Some people thrive in isolation (doesn't disprove population-level effect)
- **Cultural variation** - Different expressions of love (doesn't disprove universality)
- **Mechanism uncertainty** - Not knowing exactly HOW connection helps (doesn't disprove THAT it helps)
- **Quantum consciousness failure** - L0-L5 details wrong (doesn't affect core structural optimism claims)

---

## The Falsification Asymmetry

**Easy to falsify:** Specific quantitative claims (50% mortality reduction)

**Hard to falsify:** Structural claims (integration creates complexity)

This is appropriate - more fundamental claims should be more robust.

## Active Falsification Attempts

We actively seek disconfirming evidence:

| Search | Result |
|--------|--------|
| "Social connection no effect mortality" | No credible contradicting meta-analyses found |
| "Romantic love Western invention" | Contradicted by cross-cultural evidence |
| "Isolation health benefits" | Only for specific contexts (introvert recharge), not overall |

---

## If Falsified

**What happens if a core claim is falsified?**

1. **Acknowledge** the falsification publicly
2. **Update** the claim file with new status
3. **Major version bump** (1.0 → 2.0)
4. **Revise** dependent claims
5. **Document** in CHANGELOG

**The theory is not precious. Truth is precious.**

**Falsifiability is a feature, not a weakness.** ✨
