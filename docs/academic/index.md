## Peer Review

### Anonymous Peer Review Process

**We use Anonymous Github for double-blind peer review:**

**What is Anonymous Github?**
- Tool for anonymous peer review
- Hides author identities from reviewers
- Hides reviewer identities from authors
- Maintains academic standards
- Preserves anonymity throughout

**Why anonymous peer review?**
- Reduces bias (focus on ideas, not identity)
- Protects junior researchers
- Enables honest criticism
- Prevents conflicts of interest
- Maintains academic rigor

### How to Request Peer Review

**For major contributions:**

1. **Submit your contribution** via pull request
2. **Request peer review** in PR description: `@structural-optimism-bot request-review`
3. **We set up Anonymous Github** - Creates anonymous repository
4. **Reviewers are assigned** - Experts in relevant field
5. **Review process begins** - Double-blind feedback
6. **You respond anonymously** - Address reviewer concerns
7. **Iterate until acceptance** - Revise based on feedback
8. **Merge when approved** - Contribution integrated

**See [Peer Review Guide](peer-review.md) for detailed process.**

### Peer Review Standards

**Reviewers evaluate:**
- Evidence quality (are sources reliable?)
- Reasoning validity (is logic sound?)
- Clarity (is it understandable?)
- Originality (is it novel?)
- Significance (does it matter?)
- Rigor (is it thorough?)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Evidence is peer-reviewed and replicated
- Reasoning is logically valid
- Claims are falsifiable
- Contribution is significant
- Writing is clear
- Standards are met

### Becoming a Reviewer

**We need reviewers with expertise in:**
- Philosophy (especially philosophy of mind)
- Neuroscience (consciousness research)
- Psychology (social psychology, positive psychology)
- Physics (quantum mechanics, consciousness theories)
- Anthropology (cross-cultural studies)
- Statistics (meta-analysis, research methods)

**To volunteer as reviewer:**
1. Open issue: "Volunteer as reviewer"
2. Describe expertise
3. Provide credentials (optional, can be anonymous)
4. We'll add you to reviewer pool

**Reviewer commitment:**
- Review 2-4 contributions per year
- Provide constructive feedback
- Maintain anonymity (if desired)
- Follow review guidelines
- Meet deadlines (2-4 weeks per review)
