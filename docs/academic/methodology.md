# Methodology

**How we evaluate claims and rate confidence.**

---

## Evidence Standards

Every claim on this site follows these standards:

### 1. Peer-Reviewed Sources

We prioritize peer-reviewed research from established journals:

| Tier | Source Type | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Peer-reviewed journals | Nature, Science, PNAS, PLoS Medicine |
| 2 | Academic preprints | arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv |
| 3 | Secondary sources | Wikipedia, news articles |
| 4 | Commentary | Blog posts, social media |

**Rule:** Claims need ≥2 Tier 1-2 sources for ★★★★+ rating.

---

### 2. Confidence Ratings

| Rating | Meaning | Criteria |
|--------|---------|----------|
| ★★★★★ | Established | Multiple replications, peer-reviewed, mechanistically understood |
| ★★★★☆ | Strong | Replicated, peer-reviewed, minor gaps |
| ★★★☆☆ | Promising | Initial findings, awaiting replication |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Preliminary | Single study, speculative mechanism |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Speculative | No direct evidence, theoretical only |

---

### 3. Falsification Criteria

Every claim includes what would disprove it:

!!! example "Example: Social Connection Reduces Mortality"
    **Falsification criteria:**
    
    - Large-scale RCT showing no mortality benefit from social interventions
    - Discovery that correlation is entirely explained by confounders
    - Evidence that effect is limited to specific populations

---

### 4. Counter-Evidence Tracking

We actively track evidence that contradicts our claims:

- Counter-evidence is displayed alongside supporting evidence
- Claims are downgraded when counter-evidence accumulates
- We update immediately when new research emerges

---

## The Knowledge Graph

Our claims are stored in a knowledge graph that tracks:

- **Nodes:** Claims, Evidence, Mechanisms, Gaps, Researchers
- **Edges:** SUPPORTS, CONTRADICTS, EXPLAINS, BLOCKS
- **Temporal:** When beliefs changed and why

## Correction Process

When errors are found:

1. **Immediate acknowledgment** - We don't hide mistakes
2. **Confidence downgrade** - Rating adjusted based on severity
3. **Changelog entry** - All changes documented
4. **Source update** - Primary sources re-verified

## What We Don't Do

- **Cherry-pick** - We include counter-evidence
- **Overstate** - "Suggests" not "proves" for preliminary findings
- **Hide uncertainty** - Gaps are prominently displayed
- **Ignore criticism** - All feedback is considered

---

## Philosophical Commitments

We are transparent about our assumptions:

1. **Empiricism** - Evidence over intuition
2. **Falsifiability** - Claims must be testable
3. **Humility** - We could be wrong
4. **Integration** - Multiple disciplines inform our view
