# Open Questions and Gaps

Known unknowns that need resolution.

## Critical Gaps

### 1. In Vivo Quantum Biology Detection

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** OPEN

**The Problem:**
All quantum biology evidence comes from isolated systems (purified proteins, ex vivo tissue). No confirmation of quantum coherence in living neural tissue.

**Why It Matters:**
- Quantum consciousness theories require quantum effects IN LIVING BRAINS
- Current evidence shows quantum biology is POSSIBLE, not that it OCCURS in consciousness

**Resolution Path:**
- Google Research Awards 2025 funding in vivo quantum probes
- Expected results: 2026-2027

**Affects Claims:** Consciousness theory extensions (not core structural optimism claims)

### 2. Quantum-Classical Boundary (L0.5)

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** OPEN

**The Problem:**
Chapman University 2025 proved pure quantum consciousness is impossible (no-cloning theorem). The L0-L5 framework lacks explicit specification of how quantum effects transition to classical neural computation.

**Why It Matters:**
- Framework has logical gap between L0 (quantum) and L1 (neural)
- Mechanism for agency emergence unspecified

**Resolution Path:**
- Theoretical specification exists (DRAFT)
- Needs experimental validation

**Affects Claims:** L0-L5 consciousness theory (not core structural optimism claims)

## Medium Priority Gaps

### 3. Causal Direction in Social-Health Link

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

**The Problem:**
Reverse causation possible - sick people may become isolated, not isolation causing sickness.

**Current Status:**
- Longitudinal studies suggest bidirectional effects
- Intervention studies show mixed results
- Natural experiments (widowhood) support causal direction

**Affects Claims:** Claim 2 (social connection → mortality)

---

### 4. Optimal Social Dose

**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** OPEN

**The Problem:**
What's the optimal amount/type of social connection? Individual variation is large.

**Current Status:**
- Quality > quantity established
- Optimal "dose" varies by person
- No universal prescription possible

**Affects Claims:** Claim 4 (alignment → flourishing)

## Resolved Gaps

### ~~Observer Belief Experiments~~

**Status:** RESOLVED (FABRICATED)  
**Resolution Date:** 2026-01-15

**What Happened:**
Claims about "observer belief affecting quantum measurement" were fabricated. No such experiments exist. Physics doesn't support consciousness-dependent collapse.

**Action Taken:**
- Removed from theory
- Documented in warnings

## How to Resolve Gaps

1. **Research** the gap using local tools or Perplexity
2. **Find** peer-reviewed evidence
3. **Add** findings to Graphiti
4. **Update** this file with resolution
5. **Update** affected claim files
6. **Log** in CHANGELOG.md

**Gaps are features, not bugs. They show where to focus research.** ✨
