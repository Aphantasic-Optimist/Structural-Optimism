# Propose Corrections

**Optimistic honesty is the highest form of kindness.**

Help us maintain scientific rigor by reporting errors, outdated information, or inaccuracies. We welcome all corrections, no matter how small.

## Types of Corrections

### 1. Factual Errors

Incorrect statements or misrepresented research:

- Wrong statistics or numbers
- Misattributed quotes or findings
- Incorrect author names or dates
- Fabricated or non-existent citations

**Example**: "The framework claims 'virtually all cultures' show romantic love, but the actual study (Jankowiak & Fischer 1992) found 166 out of 186 cultures - that's 89%, not 'virtually all'."

### 2. Citation Errors

Problems with sources or references:

- Broken links or DOIs
- Incorrect citations
- Missing primary sources
- Citation laundering (citing reviews instead of original research)

**Example**: "The framework cites a review paper for the cryptochrome finding, but the primary source is Babcock et al. (2024). We should cite the original."

### 3. Outdated Information

Information that's been superseded:

- New research contradicts old claims
- Confidence ratings need updating
- Replication status has changed
- Better evidence now available

**Example**: "The framework rates this as ★★★★☆ but a 2025 meta-analysis with 10x the sample size should upgrade it to ★★★★★."

### 4. Logical Errors

Flaws in reasoning or argumentation:

- Invalid inferences
- Unfalsifiable claims
- Circular reasoning
- Missing alternative explanations

**Example**: "The claim that 'reality is structured toward integration' is presented as empirical, but it seems unfalsifiable. What would count as evidence against it?"

### 5. Interpretation Errors

Misinterpretation of research:

- Adding claims not made by original authors
- Overstating findings
- Ignoring limitations
- Cherry-picking evidence

**Example**: "The framework claims Finsler geometry supports consciousness theory, but the original physics papers make no such connection. This is interpretation, not physics."

### 6. Clarity Issues

Confusing or ambiguous language:

- Unclear explanations
- Jargon without definition
- Ambiguous claims
- Missing context

**Example**: "The section on 'quantum coherence' doesn't explain what this means or why it matters. Needs clearer explanation for general audience."

## Correction Standards

### What Makes a Good Correction?

#### Specific

**Good**: "Line 47 states '2.2 billion people' but the study had 2.2 million participants."

**Too vague**: "The numbers seem wrong."

#### Evidence-Based

**Good**: "According to the original paper (Wang et al. 2023, Table 2), the hazard ratio is 0.50, not 0.45."

**Insufficient**: "I think this number is wrong."

#### Constructive

**Good**: "This claim is unfalsifiable as stated. Suggest adding: 'This would be disproven if increased integration consistently led to worse outcomes.'"

**Unhelpful**: "This is stupid and wrong."

#### Actionable

**Good**: "Replace citation [12] with primary source: Babcock, N. S., et al. (2024). Superradiance in microtubules. *Journal of Physical Chemistry B*, 128(4), 733-748."

**Not actionable**: "The citations are bad."

## Correction Process

## Examples of Good Corrections

### Example 1: Factual Error

> **Location**: Level 1, "The Simplest Proof"
>
> **Error Type**: Factual error
>
> **Current Text**: "Social connection reduces mortality risk by 50% (Wang et al. 2023, 2.2 billion people studied)"
>
> **Issue**: Wrong number - study had 2.2 million participants, not 2.2 billion
>
> **Proposed Correction**: "Social connection reduces mortality risk by 50% (Wang et al. 2023, 2.2 million people studied)"
>
> **Evidence**: Wang et al. 2023 abstract states "meta-analysis of 148 studies comprising 2.2 million participants"
>
> **Priority**: High (affects credibility of core claim)

### Example 2: Citation Error

> **Location**: Level 5, "Evidence-Grounded Theory"
>
> **Error Type**: Citation laundering
>
> **Current Text**: "Microtubule superradiance confirmed (Review 2024)"
>
> **Issue**: Citing a review instead of primary source
>
> **Proposed Correction**: "Microtubule superradiance confirmed (Babcock et al. 2024)"
>
> **Evidence**: Babcock, N. S., et al. (2024). Superradiance in microtubules. *Journal of Physical Chemistry B*, 128(4), 733-748. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c06763
>
> **Priority**: Medium (correct finding, wrong citation)

### Example 3: Interpretation Error

> **Location**: Level 4, "Physics Integration"
>
> **Error Type**: Interpretation error
>
> **Current Text**: "Finsler geometry provides mathematical foundation for consciousness-spacetime coupling"
>
> **Issue**: Original Finsler geometry papers make no consciousness claims - this is our interpretation added to physics
>
> **Proposed Correction**: "We propose that Finsler geometry could provide a mathematical framework for consciousness-spacetime coupling (speculative interpretation, not claimed by original physics papers)"
>
> **Evidence**: Review of original Finsler geometry papers shows no mention of consciousness
>
> **Priority**: Critical (misrepresents physics as supporting consciousness theory)

### Example 4: Outdated Information

> **Location**: Level 3, "Quantum Biology"
>
> **Error Type**: Outdated information
>
> **Current Text**: "Gravitational decoherence remains untested (★★☆☆☆)"
>
> **Issue**: Gran Sasso experiment (Donadi et al. 2022) tested and constrained the simplest model
>
> **Proposed Correction**: "Gravitational decoherence: simplest Diósi-Penrose model ruled out by Gran Sasso experiment (Donadi et al. 2022), but more complex models remain viable (★★★☆☆)"
>
> **Evidence**: Donadi, S., et al. (2022). Underground test of gravity-related wave function collapse. *Nature Physics*, 18(1), 71-75.
>
> **Priority**: High (significant experimental result)
