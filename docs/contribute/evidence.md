# Submit Evidence

Help strengthen the framework by submitting peer-reviewed research, experimental findings, or systematic reviews.

## What Evidence We're Looking For

### Primary Research

- **Peer-reviewed studies**: Published in reputable journals
- **Experimental findings**: With clear methodology and results
- **Systematic reviews**: Meta-analyses and comprehensive reviews
- **Replication studies**: Independent verification of key findings

### Evidence Categories

#### ★★★★★ Established Evidence

- Multiple independent replications
- Large sample sizes (>1000 participants)
- Published in top-tier journals
- Consistent findings across research groups
- Mechanistically understood

**Example**: Cryptochrome magnetoreception in birds

#### ★★★★☆ Strong Evidence

- Replicated findings (2-3 independent studies)
- Published in peer-reviewed journals
- Some mechanistic understanding
- Minor inconsistencies or gaps

**Example**: Default Mode Network task-negative correlation

#### ★★★☆☆ Promising Evidence

- Initial peer-reviewed findings
- Awaiting independent replication
- Plausible mechanism proposed
- Needs further validation

**Example**: Xenon isotope anesthesia anomaly

#### ★★☆☆☆ Preliminary Evidence

- Single study or preprint
- Mechanism speculative
- Requires significant validation
- Interesting but unconfirmed

**Example**: Ion cyclotron resonance effects (disputed)

#### ★☆☆☆☆ Theoretical/Speculative

- No direct experimental evidence
- Mathematically consistent but untested
- Requires extraordinary evidence
- Philosophical or interpretive

**Example**: Spacetime-consciousness coupling

## Evidence Standards

### Required Information

All evidence submissions must include:

1. **Full citation**: Authors, year, title, journal, DOI
2. **Primary source**: Link to original paper (not review/summary)
3. **Key findings**: What was actually observed/measured
4. **Methodology**: How the study was conducted
5. **Relevance**: How this relates to framework claims

### Quality Criteria

We assess evidence using GRADE methodology:

#### Study Quality (Risk of Bias)
- Pre-registration status
- Adequate controls
- Appropriate blinding
- Sufficient sample size
- Proper statistical methods

#### Replication Status (Consistency)
- Independent replication
- Consistent across research groups
- Similar effect sizes
- No major conflicting findings

#### Relevance (Directness)
- Directly tests the claim
- Minimal bridging arguments needed
- Original authors make relevant claims
- Appropriate domain

#### Precision (Effect Size)
- Narrow confidence intervals
- Meaningful effect size
- Adequate statistical power
- Not likely noise

#### Publication Bias
- Negative results published
- No file drawer problem
- Peer-reviewed (not just preprint)
- Unpublished replications available

### What We Don't Accept

- **Non-peer-reviewed sources**: Blog posts, social media, news articles (unless citing primary research)
- **Tertiary sources**: Wikipedia, encyclopedias (use their citations instead)
- **Cherry-picked evidence**: Must include contradictory findings
- **Misrepresented research**: Claims not made by original authors
- **Fabricated connections**: Adding consciousness claims to physics papers that don't make them

## Evidence Integration Process

### 1. Submission Review

We review submissions for:
- Relevance to framework
- Source quality
- Methodological rigor
- Replication status

### 2. Verification

We verify:
- Citation accuracy
- Primary source access
- Author claims vs. interpretation
- Contradictory evidence

### 3. Assessment

We assess using:
- GRADE methodology
- Confidence rating (★ system)
- Replication status
- Potential limitations

### 4. Integration

We integrate by:
- Adding to relevant sections
- Updating confidence ratings
- Noting contradictions
- Documenting reasoning

### 5. Recognition

Contributors are:
- Acknowledged in relevant sections
- Listed in project contributors
- Cited in academic outputs (if desired)
- Invited to collaborate (for substantial contributions)

## Types of Evidence Contributions

### Supporting Evidence

Evidence that strengthens existing claims:

- Independent replications
- Larger sample sizes

- Cross-cultural confirmation

### Contradictory Evidence

Evidence that challenges existing claims:

- Failed replications
- Contradictory findings
- Alternative explanations
- Methodological critiques

**Note**: Contradictory evidence is valuable! We actively seek it to maintain rigor.

### Novel Evidence

Evidence for new claims or mechanisms:

- Unexplored domains
- New experimental techniques
- Cross-disciplinary connections
- Emerging research areas

### Meta-Evidence

Evidence about evidence:
