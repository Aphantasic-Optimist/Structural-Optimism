# Request Research

Help us identify areas that need investigation, verification, or deeper exploration.

## What Makes a Good Research Request?

### Specific and Focused

**Good**: "Verify the replication status of Kerskens et al. (2022) brain entanglement findings"

**Too broad**: "Research quantum consciousness"

### Relevant to Framework

Research requests should connect to:
- The core proof (reality structured toward integration)
- Evidence ratings (★ system)
- Specific claims in the framework
- Identified gaps or limitations

### Actionable

Include:
- Specific question or hypothesis
- Relevant existing research
- Why this matters to the framework
- Suggested search terms or databases

## Types of Research Requests

### 1. Verification Requests

Ask us to verify or update existing claims:

- Check replication status
- Update confidence ratings
- Find primary sources
- Verify citations

**Example**: "The framework cites Wang et al. (2023) on social connection and mortality. Has this been independently replicated?"

### 2. Gap Identification

Point out missing evidence or unexplored areas:

- Mechanisms without empirical support
- Claims lacking primary sources
- Contradictory findings not addressed
- Alternative explanations not considered

**Example**: "The framework discusses quantum coherence in microtubules but doesn't address the warm-wet-noisy problem. What's the current evidence on decoherence timescales?"

### 3. Extension Proposals

Suggest new areas to explore:

- Related research domains
- Cross-cultural evidence
- Practical applications
- Experimental designs

**Example**: "Has anyone studied whether meditation practices that emphasize interconnection show measurable effects on prosocial behavior?"

### 4. Critique and Challenge

Challenge existing claims constructively:

- Point out logical flaws
- Identify unfalsifiable claims
- Suggest alternative interpretations
- Highlight contradictory evidence

**Example**: "The claim that 'reality is structured toward integration' seems unfalsifiable. What would count as evidence against this?"

## How to Submit a Research Request

### Option 1: GitHub Issues (Recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/[username]/structural-optimism/issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Research Request" template
4. Fill in the template:
   - **Title**: Brief, specific description
   - **Question**: What needs investigation?
   - **Context**: Why does this matter?
   - **Existing Research**: What's already known?
   - **Suggested Approach**: How might we investigate this?
5. Submit and engage with responses

### Option 2: GitHub Discussions

For more exploratory or open-ended requests:

1. Go to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/[username]/structural-optimism/discussions)
2. Start a new discussion in "Research Ideas"
3. Describe your research question
4. Engage with community feedback

### Option 3: Anonymous Submission

If you prefer anonymity:

1. Use [gitGost](anonymous.md) to submit anonymously
2. Or email research requests to [contact email]
3. We'll post on your behalf (attribution optional)

## Research Request Template

```markdown
## Research Question
[Clear, specific question]

## Relevance to Framework
[Which claim/section does this relate to?]

## Current State
[What do we currently know or claim?]

## Gap or Issue
[What's missing, unclear, or potentially wrong?]

## Suggested Investigation
[How might we address this?]

## Relevant Sources
[Any papers, databases, or resources to check]

## Priority
[ ] Critical (affects core claims)
[ ] High (strengthens major arguments)
[ ] Medium (fills important gaps)
[ ] Low (interesting but not essential)
```

## What Happens Next?

1. **Triage**: We review and prioritize requests
2. **Investigation**: Researchers investigate using systematic methods
3. **Documentation**: Findings are documented with sources
4. **Integration**: Results are integrated into the framework
5. **Update**: You're notified of outcomes

## Current Research Priorities

We're actively seeking help with:

### High Priority

- **Replication verification**: Checking replication status of key studies
- **Cross-cultural evidence**: Expanding beyond Western research
- **Mechanism validation**: Verifying proposed biological mechanisms
- **Falsification criteria**: Developing testable predictions

### Medium Priority

- **Historical analysis**: Tracing ideas through intellectual history
- **Practical applications**: Testing framework predictions in real-world settings
- **Alternative explanations**: Exploring competing interpretations
- **Edge cases**: Identifying boundary conditions

### Ongoing

- **Literature monitoring**: Tracking new publications
- **Citation verification**: Ensuring all sources are accurate
- **Evidence updates**: Refreshing confidence ratings
- **Gap resolution**: Addressing identified limitations

## Research Standards

All research conducted follows rigorous scientific standards with systematic evidence assessment, primary source citation, replication focus, transparency in methods and reasoning, and clear falsifiability criteria.

## Recognition

Research contributors are:

- Acknowledged in relevant sections
- Listed in project contributors
- Cited in academic outputs (if desired)
- Invited to co-author papers (for substantial contributions)

## Examples of Great Research Requests

### Example 1: Verification Request

> **Title**: Verify social connection mortality reduction claim
>
> **Question**: The framework states "social connection reduces mortality risk by 50%". Is this accurate?
>
> **Context**: This is a core claim in Level 1 (The Simplest Proof)
>
> **Current State**: Cited as Wang et al. (2023), 2.2M people studied
>
> **Request**: Verify this is the correct citation, check if 50% is accurate, look for independent replication
>
> **Priority**: Critical

### Example 2: Gap Identification

> **Title**: Missing mechanism for quantum-to-neural timescale bridging
>
> **Question**: How do femtosecond quantum effects influence millisecond neural processing?
>
> **Context**: Framework proposes quantum effects in consciousness but doesn't explain timescale gap
>
> **Current State**: Mentions ENAQT but lacks detailed mechanism
>
> **Request**: Search for research on timescale bridging in quantum biology
>
> **Priority**: High

### Example 3: Extension Proposal

> **Title**: Investigate structural optimism in non-Western philosophies
>
> **Question**: Do non-Western philosophical traditions contain similar ideas about reality's structure?
>
> **Context**: Framework is currently Western-centric
>
> **Request**: Survey Buddhist, Taoist, Indigenous, and other traditions for parallel concepts
>
> **Priority**: Medium
