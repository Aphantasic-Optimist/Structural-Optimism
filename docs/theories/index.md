# Consciousness Theories

**Status:** Research frameworks with explicit confidence ratings

This section presents rigorous theoretical frameworks for understanding consciousness, each with clear evidence standards, falsification criteria, and honest assessment of what we know versus what we're exploring.

---

## Core Principle

**Follow evidence, not hope. Acknowledge limits. Build defensible claims. Falsify mercilessly.**

These theories are presented with explicit confidence ratings:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ★★★★★ | Established - replicated, peer-reviewed |
| ★★★★☆ | Strong - replicated, minor gaps |
| ★★★☆☆ | Promising - awaiting replication |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Preliminary - single study |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Speculative - theoretical only |

## Why These Theories Matter

Understanding consciousness isn't just academic curiosity. It's about:

1. **Grounding the practice** - Why connection matters (physics, not feelings)
2. **Honest assessment** - What we know vs. what we're exploring
3. **Falsifiable predictions** - How to test and potentially disprove claims
4. **Integration with evidence** - How theory connects to [the proof](../proof/simple.md)

---

## Key Insights

### What We Know (★★★★★)

- **Quantum biology exists** - Cryptochrome magnetoreception in birds is established
- **Integration correlates with consciousness** - IIT has substantial (though disputed) evidence
- **Social connection reduces mortality** - 50% reduction, 2.2M people studied
- **Love is universal** - Found across 166 cultures

### What We're Exploring (★★★☆☆)

- **Quantum effects in brain** - Xenon isotope anesthesia suggests quantum sensitivity
- **Microtubule superradiance** - Demonstrated in purified proteins, not yet in living neural tissue
- **Consciousness-spacetime coupling** - Mathematical possibility, no empirical tests yet

### What We Track (★☆☆☆☆)

- **Observer belief effects** - Philosophical interpretation, not physics claim
- **THz informational fields** - Theoretical construct, needs detection method
- **Quantum error correction in brain** - Conceptually possible, biologically implausible

---

## The Honest Approach

These theories acknowledge:

- **Correlation ≠ causation** - Neural correlates don't explain mechanism
- **Timescale problem** - Quantum effects (femtoseconds) vs. neural processing (milliseconds)
- **Alternative explanations** - Classical mechanisms may be sufficient
- **Replication matters** - Single studies are preliminary, not conclusive

**We track speculative ideas, we don't dismiss them.** But we're honest about evidence quality.

---

## How to Read These Theories

1. **Check the confidence rating** - Know what's established vs. speculative
2. **Look for falsification criteria** - What would disprove the claim?
3. **Verify primary sources** - Are citations to actual papers or interpretations?
4. **Separate physics from interpretation** - What does the research actually say?

---

## Connection to Practice

These theories ground [the daily practice](../practical/daily-practice.md) in physics:

- **Integration creates complexity** - Atoms → molecules → cells → you → relationships
- **We experience integration as good** - Love, connection, meaning
- **Extraction depletes** - Isolation increases mortality by 32%
- **Alignment with reality's structure** - Not faith, observation

**Phone down. Eyes up. Smile and wave.** That's alignment with physics.

---

## For Researchers

If you're investigating consciousness:

- **Use the evidence hierarchy** - Assess source quality systematically
- **Check the theories landscape** - See where your work fits
- **Apply scientific rigor** - Verify claims, acknowledge limits
- **Propose falsifiable tests** - How could you be wrong?

---

## For Skeptics

Good. Skepticism is essential.

These theories are designed to be:
- **Falsifiable** - Clear criteria for what would disprove them
- **Honest about limits** - Explicit confidence ratings
- **Grounded in evidence** - Primary sources cited
- **Open to revision** - Updated as new evidence emerges

**If you find errors, that's valuable.** Science advances through correction.
