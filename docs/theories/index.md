# Consciousness Theories

**Status:** Research frameworks with explicit confidence ratings

This section presents consciousness theories organized by their level of empirical support—from established neuroscience to speculative quantum mechanisms.

---

## How to Navigate

Theories are organized into **three layers** based on evidence strength:

| Layer | Evidence Level | What You'll Find |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **🧠 Established** | ★★★★★ to ★★★★☆ | Neuroscience, social connection, proven mechanisms |
| **🔬 Emerging** | ★★★☆☆ to ★★☆☆☆ | Quantum biology, IIT, testable hypotheses |
| **⚛️ Speculative** | ★★☆☆☆ to ★☆☆☆☆ | Quantum consciousness, L0.5 interface, theoretical frameworks |

**Confidence Scale:**

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ★★★★★ | Established - replicated, peer-reviewed |
| ★★★★☆ | Strong - replicated, minor gaps |
| ★★★☆☆ | Promising - awaiting replication |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Preliminary - single study |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Speculative - theoretical only |

## Why This Organization?

**Layer 1 (Established)** - Start here if you want proven mechanisms. Social connection, neural correlates, evolutionary biology.

**Layer 2 (Emerging)** - Go here if you're curious about cutting-edge research. IIT, quantum biology, testable hypotheses.

**Layer 3 (Speculative)** - Explore here if you want theoretical frameworks. Quantum consciousness, L0.5 interface, comprehensive models.

**Meta-Resources** - Use these to understand how we assess everything else.

## Connection to Practice

These theories ground [the daily practice](../practical/daily-practice.md) in physics:

- **[Integration creates complexity](../claims/01-integration-creates-complexity.md)** - Atoms → molecules → cells → you → relationships (★★★★★)
- **We experience integration as good** - Love, connection, meaning (★★★★★)
- **Extraction depletes** - [Isolation increases mortality by 32%](../claims/02-social-connection-reduces-mortality.md) (★★★★★)
- **[Alignment with reality's structure](../claims/04-alignment-enables-flourishing.md)** - Not faith, observation (★★★★☆)

**Phone down. Eyes up. Smile and wave.** That's alignment with physics.

---

## The Honest Approach

These theories acknowledge:

- **Correlation ≠ causation** - Neural correlates don't explain mechanism
- **Timescale problem** - Quantum effects (femtoseconds) vs. neural processing (milliseconds)
- **Alternative explanations** - Classical mechanisms may be sufficient
- **Replication matters** - Single studies are preliminary, not conclusive

**We track speculative ideas, we don't dismiss them.** But we're honest about evidence quality.

---

## For Researchers

If you're investigating consciousness:

- **Start with Layer 1** - Understand established mechanisms
- **Explore Layer 2** - See where cutting-edge research is heading
- **Consider Layer 3** - Theoretical frameworks for long-term investigation
- **Use Meta-Resources** - Assess source quality systematically

---

## For Skeptics

Good. Skepticism is essential.

These theories are designed to be:
- **Falsifiable** - Clear criteria for what would disprove them
- **Honest about limits** - Explicit confidence ratings organized by layer
- **Grounded in evidence** - Primary sources cited
- **Open to revision** - Updated as new evidence emerges

**If you find errors, that's valuable.** Science advances through correction.
