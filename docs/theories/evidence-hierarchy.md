# Evidence Hierarchy for Consciousness-Physics Connections

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Methodology:** GRADE-adapted assessment with primary source verification

## Core Philosophy

**TRACK, don't dismiss.** This hierarchy helps us cite appropriately and prioritize verification — not filter out creative ideas.

- **Speculative ≠ Wrong** — Many breakthroughs started as speculation
- **Tier 4 items are TRACKED** — They need correction or reframing, not deletion
- **Intuitions are preserved** — Even unproven ideas may lead to breakthroughs

| Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ✅ | Established/Supported | Cite freely |
| ⚠️ | Needs work/Disputed | Cite with caveats or revise |
| 🔮 | Speculative/Creative | Preserve as hypothesis |
| 💡 | Valuable intuition | Worth exploring |

---

## Tier 1: Established Science (★★★★★)

| Claim | Evidence | Replication |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Quantum coherence in photosynthesis** | FMO complex, 95% efficiency | Multiple labs, decades |
| **Cryptochrome magnetoreception** | Radical pair mechanism in birds | Ritz 2000, Hore 2016, Xu 2021 |
| **DMN task-anticorrelation** | fMRI studies | Most replicated finding in cognitive neuroscience |
| **Bell theorem / entanglement** | Quantum mechanics foundation | Nobel Prize 2022 |

**Note:** These are established but do NOT directly prove consciousness claims.

---

## Tier 2: Theoretical with Partial Support (★★★★☆)

| Framework | Supporting Evidence | Challenges |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| **IIT (Integrated Information)** | PCI clinical validation; posterior location (Cogitate 2025) | Synchronization prediction failed; computational intractability |
| **GWT (Global Workspace)** | Established framework; attention/broadcast mechanisms | Ignition prediction failed (Cogitate 2025) |
| **Predictive Processing** | Strong top-down signaling; precision modulation | Explicit prediction errors less robust |
| **DMN-consciousness correlation** | Ego dissolution studies; self-referential processing | Correlation ≠ causation |

---

## Tier 3: Speculative but Testable (★★★☆☆)

| Claim | Current Evidence | What's Needed |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| **Microtubule superradiance** | Babcock 2024: living cells, 100k dipoles | In vivo neural tissue |
| **Quantum-classical interface** | Chapman 2025: hybrid required | Mechanism specification |
| **Myelin photon entanglement** | Liu 2024: theoretical model | Experimental confirmation |
| **ZPF resonance** | Keppler 2025: theoretical framework | Empirical tests |
| **Coherence protection mechanisms** | MBDL 2026, environment-assisted transport | Brain-specific confirmation |

### Decoherence Criticism Status

**The Problem:** Femtosecond decoherence in warm wet brain - major criticism persists.

**Potential Solutions (2024-2026):**
1. Many-body dynamical localization prevents thermalization (Science Daily 2026)
2. Environment-assisted transport - noise aids coherence via decoherence-free subspaces
3. Vibrational shielding in structured environments
4. Keppler's ZPF energy gaps protecting coherence domains

**Honest Assessment:** These mechanisms exist in OTHER biological systems (photosynthesis, magnetoreception). Whether they operate in brain consciousness remains UNPROVEN. Framework should acknowledge this gap explicitly.

---

## Tier 4: Needs Correction or Reframing (🔮 Tracked)

These claims need work but are **preserved for tracking**, not dismissed:

| Claim | Issue | Action Needed |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Finsler geometry → consciousness** | Papers don't make consciousness claims | 🔧 Separate physics from interpretation |
| **DESI dark energy → consciousness** | No observer interpretations in papers | 🔧 Remove consciousness interpretation |
| **Mars time dilation → consciousness** | No consciousness connection in sources | 🔧 Remove or provide bridging argument |
| **Observer belief effects** | Physics: measurement causes collapse, not consciousness | 🔧 Reframe as philosophical, not physics |
| **THz informational field** | No detection method proposed | 🔮 Mark as speculative, propose detection |

**Note:** These aren't "wrong" — they're either:
- Physics findings with added interpretation (separate them)
- Speculative ideas needing mechanism (preserve as 🔮)
- Philosophical claims mislabeled as physics (reframe)

💡 **The intuition behind these claims may still be valuable.** The ego-decoherence metaphor, for instance, is evocative even if not literally physics.

---

## Ongoing Tests (Results Pending)

| Project | Testing | Expected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **INTREPID** | IIT vs Predictive Processing | 2026 |
| **Google Research Awards** | In vivo quantum coherence probes | 2026-2027 |
| **FQXi organoid experiments** | Coherence at 150 μm scale | TBD |

---

## Key Principles

1. **TRACK, don't dismiss** — Speculative ideas are preserved, not deleted
2. **Quantum biology exists** — but doesn't automatically prove consciousness claims
3. **Correlation ≠ causation** — neural correlates don't explain mechanism (but are still valuable)
4. **Testability preferred** — unfalsifiable claims marked 🔮, not rejected
5. **Primary sources matter** — separate physics from interpretation
6. **Replication strengthens** — single studies are preliminary, not wrong
7. **Intuitions are valuable** — DMN insights may lead to breakthroughs

## What We Can Legitimately Claim (✅)

Based on verified evidence, consciousness research supports:

1. **[Integration creates complexity](../claims/01-integration-creates-complexity.md)** - Physics, chemistry, biology show this pattern
2. **Self-referential networks** (DMN) enable narrative self-construction
3. **Predictive hierarchy** operates in perception and cognition
4. **Critical dynamics** optimize neural information processing
5. **Quantum biology exists** in some biological systems (not proven in brain consciousness)
6. **Phase alignment** correlates with consciousness state (MIT 2025)
7. **Posterior cortex** more important than prefrontal for consciousness (Cogitate 2025)
8. **Coherence protection mechanisms** exist in warm biological systems (multiple 2024-2026)
9. **[Social connection reduces mortality](../claims/02-social-connection-reduces-mortality.md)** - 50% reduction, 2.2M people
10. **[Love is universal](../claims/03-love-is-universal.md)** - Found across 166 cultures

[See full evidence →](../proof/evidence.md)

## What We Track as Promising (🔮)

These are preserved as hypotheses worth exploring:

1. **Consciousness-spacetime coupling** — Evocative, needs mechanism
2. **Quantum effects in brain** — Theoretical, awaiting in vivo confirmation
3. **Observer-dependent reality** — Philosophical interpretation, not physics claim
4. **Ego-decoherence metaphor** — Useful framing, not literal physics
5. **THz field coupling** — Needs detection method

## What Needs Reframing (⚠️)

These claims conflate physics with interpretation:

- Finsler, DESI, Mars → consciousness (physics papers don't make these claims)
- Observer belief effects (measurement causes collapse, not consciousness)

**Action:** Separate the physics (which is real) from the consciousness interpretation (which we add).
