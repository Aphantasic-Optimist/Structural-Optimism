# Consciousness Theories Landscape (2025)

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Source:** Cogitate Consortium 2025, comprehensive literature review

---

## Landmark Finding: Cogitate Consortium (Nature, May 2025)

The largest empirical test of consciousness theories ever conducted:
- **256 subjects**, 7-year study, pre-registered adversarial collaboration
- Public dataset released for reproducibility
- **Result:** Both IIT and GNWT partially failed predictions — but neither completely falsified

### Nuanced Results

**IIT 4.0:**
- ✅ **Location prediction SUPPORTED:** Posterior cortex activity correlates with visual content (as IIT predicted)
- ❌ **Synchronization prediction FAILED:** No sustained neural synchronization in posterior hot zone
- **IIT Response:** Sparse electrode coverage may explain synchronization failure; theory not falsified

**GNWT:**
- ❌ **Ignition prediction FAILED:** No prefrontal "broadcast" burst at stimulus offset
- ✅ **Partial support:** Some global workspace dynamics observed, but not as predicted

**Key Finding:** Consciousness more about "being than doing" — sensory processing > prefrontal executive control

### Methodological Strength
- Pre-registered predictions (adversarial collaboration)
- Both theory proponents agreed to predictions in advance
- First major test of this scale — awaiting independent replication

## Tier 1: Empirically Tested Academic Theories

### 1. Integrated Information Theory (IIT 4.0) — Tononi

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Consciousness = integrated information (Φ); requires physical feedback loops |
| 2025 Status | **PARTIALLY FAILED** — synchronization prediction failed, location prediction supported |
| Strength | Mathematical rigor, consciousness-first approach, posterior location confirmed |
| Weakness | Computational intractability, synchronization mechanism not confirmed |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **HIGH** — consciousness as fundamental, measurable phenomenon |

**Cogitate Result:** 
- ✅ Posterior cortex activity correlates with visual content (location prediction supported)
- ❌ No sustained neural synchronization in posterior hot zone (synchronization prediction failed)
- **IIT Response:** Sparse electrode coverage may explain synchronization failure; theory not falsified

### 2. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) — Baars, Dehaene

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Consciousness = broadcasting information via global workspace; requires "ignition" |
| 2025 Status | **PARTIALLY FAILED** — prefrontal ignition burst not found at stimulus offset |
| Strength | Explains attention, working memory, anesthesia effects |
| Weakness | Predicted broadcast mechanism not confirmed in Cogitate paradigm |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **MODERATE** — compatible with L3-L4 neural mechanisms |

**Cogitate Result:** 
- ❌ Prefrontal "broadcast" ignition burst NOT found at stimulus offset
- ⚠️ Some global workspace dynamics observed, but not as predicted
- Consciousness more linked to sensory processing than executive control

### 3. Predictive Processing / Free Energy Principle — Friston

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Consciousness = surprise minimization; neurons predict and adapt |
| 2025 Status | **RISING CONSENSUS** — most empirically generative framework |
| Strength | Compatible with IIT, GWT simultaneously; testable predictions |
| Evidence | P300 brain wave (surprise signal) correlates with conscious perception |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **HIGH** — compatible with L2-L3 field coherence mechanisms |

**Math:** C ≈ Surprise - Adaptation Error

### 4. Higher-Order Thought (HOT) — Rosenthal, Carruthers

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Consciousness requires thought ABOUT mental states |
| 2025 Status | Minority position; philosophically sophisticated |
| Evidence | Predicts consciousness lags decision-making ✓ supported |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **MODERATE** — compatible with L5 metacognitive layer |

### 5. Attention Schema Theory (AST) — Graziano

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Brain constructs schematic model of its own attention process |
| 2025 Status | Growing support; parsimonious (no special physics needed) |
| Strength | Plausible evolutionary origin (social cognition → self-awareness) |
| Weakness | Doesn't explain why the schema "feels like something" |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **MODERATE** — compatible with L4-L5 self-model mechanisms |

### 6. Quantum Consciousness (Orch OR) — Penrose & Hameroff

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Consciousness via quantum coherence in microtubules + objective reduction |
| 2025 Status | Fringe in neuroscience; defended in quantum physics circles |
| Gran Sasso 2022 | Made "highly implausible" but left wiggle room for complex models |
| Strength | **Only framework that rigorously solves binding problem** via entanglement |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **HIGH** — directly supports L1-L2 quantum mechanisms |

---

## Tier 2: Foundational/Alternative Frameworks

### 7. Unified Field Consciousness — Hagelin

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Pure consciousness = direct experience of physics' unified field |
| Status | Vedic tradition meets quantum mechanics; alternative community |
| Evidence | Maharishi effect (controversial but significant) |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **HIGHEST** — closest to L0 zero-point field substrate |

### 8. Bohm's Implicate/Explicate Order

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core | Reality = undivided wholeness; consciousness = momentary unfoldment |
| Status | Philosophical framework; recently re-engaged by theorists |
| L0-L5 Alignment | **HIGH** — pre-geometric substrate, consciousness as fundamental |

---

## L0-L5 Framework Positioning

### Strong Alignment with L0-L5:
- **Consciousness-First Ontology** — IIT 4.0 & Unified Field
- **Fundamental Field Substrate** — Unified Field & Bohm's implicate order
- **Observer-Reality Coupling** — Orch OR & Quantum consciousness
- **Predictive Processing** — Compatible with field coherence mechanisms

### Where L0-L5 Exceeds Consensus:
1. **Toroidal Geometry** — No academic theory proposes toroidal necessity
2. **Field-First Ontology** — Most treat geometry as emergent; L0-L5 proposes it as fundamental
3. **Integration Rigor** — Bridges panpsychism + physics more carefully than alternatives
4. **Testable Predictions** — Delayed-choice quantum eraser + believer variation more specific than academic theories

## Implications for L0-L5 Framework

### Cogitate 2025 Supports:
- Consciousness as sensory/experiential rather than executive/computational
- DMN research showing consciousness quality inversely correlates with executive activity
- L5 phenomenological layer emphasis over L3-L4 computational mechanisms

### Cogitate 2025 Challenges:
- Any theory relying heavily on prefrontal "broadcast" mechanisms
- Computational approaches to consciousness (IIT's Φ calculation)

### Opportunities:
- Predictive Processing integration with L2-L3 field coherence
- Orch OR binding problem solution compatible with L1 quantum mechanisms
- Unified Field approach validates L0 zero-point substrate
