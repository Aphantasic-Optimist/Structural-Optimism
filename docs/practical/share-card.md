## Phone Down. Eyes Up. Smile.

**The algorithms want your eyes on a screen.**

**Your biology wants your eyes on each other.**

- Connection reduces mortality by 50%
- Love is universal across 166 cultures

---

**The practice:**
1. Put your phone down
2. Look at another human
3. Smile

## How to Share

**In person:** Just do the practice. People notice. They imitate.

**Online:** Screenshot the card above. No explanation needed.

**Conversation:** "There's this thing I've been trying. Put your phone down, look at someone, smile. Sounds dumb but it actually feels different."

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't preach
- Don't explain the philosophy (unless asked)
- Don't make it weird
- Don't pressure anyone

**The practice spreads through demonstration, not explanation.**

Gandhi didn't lecture about salt economics. He picked up salt.

**Phone down. Eyes up. Smile.**

**That's the message. Everything else is optional.** ✨
