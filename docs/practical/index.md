# Practice

**Philosophy without practice is just words. Here's how to live it.**

---

## The Core Practice

**Phone down. Eyes up. Smile.**

That's it. Start there. Everything else builds on this.

## Why Practice Matters

Gandhi didn't explain British economic exploitation in lectures.

He picked up salt. He spun thread. He wore homespun cloth.

**The action WAS the message.** You didn't need to understand the theory. Doing it made you part of the movement.

**Structural optimism works the same way.**

You don't need to understand the neuroscience of connection. You don't need to read the meta-analyses. You don't need to grasp the philosophy.

**You just need to:**
- Put the phone down
- Look someone in the eyes
- Smile

**The understanding comes through the doing.**

## The Progression

**Week 1:** Daily practice (phone down, eyes up, smile—once a day)

**Week 2-4:** Deepen the practice (three times a day, phone-free meals)

**Month 2:** Extend to relationships (real conversations, presence practice)

**Month 3+:** Extend to community (create gatherings, lower barriers, build bridges)

**Ongoing:** Integration without dissolution (maintain self while connecting)

## Common Questions

**"I don't have time."**

The daily practice takes one minute. You have one minute.

**"I'm an introvert."**

Quality over quantity. One genuine moment of connection is worth more than hours of shallow interaction.

**"People are terrible."**

Some are. Most aren't. Negativity bias makes us remember bad interactions. Most humans are kind when given the chance.

**"This seems too simple."**

Simple isn't the same as easy. And simple scales. Complex solutions don't spread. "Phone down, eyes up, smile" can spread to everyone.

## The Evidence

You don't need to believe this. You can test it.

- Do the daily practice for one week
- Notice how it feels
- Compare to a week without it

**The evidence is in your experience.**

But if you want external validation: 2.2 million people in peer-reviewed studies. Social connection reduces mortality by 50%. This is established science.

## Start Now

Not tomorrow. Not after you finish reading. Now.

Put your phone down.

Look at another human being.

Smile.

**You just practiced structural optimism.**

**Do it again tomorrow.**
