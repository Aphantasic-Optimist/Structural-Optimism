## The Essential Practice

### Step 1: Love Yourself First (ME)

Before you can integrate healthily, you need a stable self:

- Know your boundaries
- Honor your needs
- Trust your experience
- Develop your identity

**Without self-love, integration becomes dissolution.**

### Step 2: Then Integrate (WE)

Once you have a stable ME, you can join WE:

- Connect with others
- Build community
- Contribute to something larger
- Experience collective flourishing

### Step 3: Oscillate (ME ↔ WE)

Health is not static—it's rhythmic:

- Sometimes you need more ME (solitude, boundaries, rest)
- Sometimes you need more WE (connection, community, contribution)
- The oscillation IS the practice
- Both/and, not either/or
