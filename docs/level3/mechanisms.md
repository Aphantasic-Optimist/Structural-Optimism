# Mechanisms of Integration

How integration actually works in different systems.

## Biological Mechanisms

Living systems demonstrate integration through:
- Cellular cooperation
- Organ system coordination
- Ecosystem interdependence

## Social Mechanisms

Human societies integrate through:
- Communication networks
- Shared meaning systems
- Cooperative institutions

## Psychological Mechanisms

Individual minds integrate through:
- Pattern recognition
- Meaning-making
- Identity formation

## Physical Mechanisms

Even physical systems show integration:
- Emergent properties
- Self-organization
- Complexity increase

## Understanding the Pattern

Across all these domains, we see the same fundamental structure: parts coming together to create wholes that are more than their sum.
