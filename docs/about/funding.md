**Complete transparency about how this project is funded and why it matters.**

---

## Current Funding Status

**This project is:**
- ✅ Independently created by one individual
- ✅ Self-funded (no external funding)
- ✅ Not affiliated with any organization
- ✅ Not seeking profit or donations
- ✅ Freely available to everyone

**This project is NOT:**
- ❌ Funded by any corporation

- ❌ Funded by any religious organization
- ❌ Funded by any political group
- ❌ Seeking donations or contributions

## Why This Matters

### Independence Enables Honesty

**Without external funding:**
- No pressure to conform to donor interests
- No obligation to support specific agendas
- No risk of funding withdrawal for controversial claims
- No need to please sponsors
- No conflicts of interest

**This enables:**
- Radical honesty about evidence
- Willingness to correct errors
- Freedom to follow evidence wherever it leads
- Ability to criticize powerful interests
- Independence from institutional pressures

### No Financial Incentives

**This project does not:**
- Sell books or courses
- Charge for access
- Require membership fees
- Accept donations
- Monetize content
- Seek profit

**Why?**
- Keeps focus on truth, not profit
- Prevents exploitation of vulnerable people
- Avoids financial conflicts of interest
- Maintains independence
- Models non-commercial knowledge sharing

### Sustainability Model

**How is this sustainable without funding?**

**Current model:**
- Author self-funds (personal time and resources)
- GitHub provides free hosting (GitHub Pages)
- MkDocs Material is open source (free)
- Community contributes voluntarily (no payment)
- No ongoing costs beyond time

**This works because:**
- Static site (no server costs)
- Open source tools (no licensing fees)
- Volunteer contributions (no payroll)
- Simple infrastructure (minimal maintenance)
- No profit motive (no growth pressure)

**Limitations:**
- Author has limited time
- Updates may be slow
- No paid staff
- No marketing budget
- Organic growth only

**Trade-off:** Slower growth, but complete independence.

- GitHub Pages hosting: $0 (free)
- MkDocs Material: $0 (open source)
- Community contributions: $0 (volunteer)

**Total annual cost: ~$15 (or $0 if using github.io domain)**

## Future Funding Considerations

### What If This Grows?

**If the project grows significantly:**

**Potential needs:**
- Translation services (professional quality)
- Accessibility improvements (expert consultation)
- Research verification (academic collaboration)
- Community moderation (time-intensive)
- Infrastructure scaling (if traffic increases)

**Possible funding models:**

**Option 1: Remain unfunded**
- Rely on volunteer contributions
- Accept slower growth
- Maintain complete independence
- Keep it simple

**Option 2: Accept institutional grants**
- Apply for research grants
- Partner with universities
- Maintain editorial independence
- Disclose all funding sources

**Option 3: Community funding**
- Optional donations (never required)
- Transparent accounting
- No special access for donors
- Maintain free access for all

**Current decision: Option 1 (remain unfunded)**

**Why?**
- Maintains independence
- Avoids conflicts of interest
- Keeps focus on truth
- Prevents exploitation
- Models non-commercial approach

**This may change if needs evolve, but any change will be:**
- Transparent (announced publicly)
- Justified (clear reasoning)
- Limited (minimal funding only)
- Independent (no strings attached)

6. **Hide funding sources** - Complete transparency always
7. **Prioritize donors** - No special access or influence

**These are non-negotiable principles.**
