# About Structural Optimism

**An evidence-based framework showing that reality is structured toward integration—and a simple practice to align with it.**

---

## What This Is

Three facts:
1. **Connection keeps us alive** — 2.2 million people studied
2. **Love is universal** — 166 cultures examined
3. **Cooperation creates complexity** — Physics, chemistry, biology

One conclusion:
**Reality is structured toward integration. We experience integration as love.**

One practice:
**Phone down. Eyes up. Smile.**

---

## What This Isn't

**Not naive optimism.** We acknowledge suffering exists. We accept the universe has no cosmic plan. We recognize bad things happen.

**Not nihilism.** We observe that reality has a structure. That structure favors integration. We can align with it.

**Not a religion.** No faith required. Verify the evidence yourself. Disagree if you want.

**Not a movement with leaders.** No gurus. No membership. No donations. Just an idea and a practice.

---

## The Principles

1. **Evidence first** — Every claim is grounded in peer-reviewed research
2. **Optimistic honesty** — Truth matters more than comfort
3. **ME and WE** — Individual autonomy AND collective flourishing
4. **Distributed authority** — No leaders, no personality cults
5. **Free to leave** — Always. No exceptions.
