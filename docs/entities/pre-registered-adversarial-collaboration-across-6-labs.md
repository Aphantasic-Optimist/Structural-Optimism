# Pre-registered adversarial collaboration across 6 labs

**Type:** Entity  
**Confidence:** ★★★☆☆ Promising

---

## Summary

Cogitate Consortium (2025) multi-lab pre-registered adversarial collaboration testing IIT and GWT consciousness theories. Both theories' predictions failed - no sustained posterior synchronization or prefrontal ignition observed as predicted.
