# Solutions

**The problem is extraction. The solution is integration. Here's how.**

---

## The Core Solution

**Phone down. Eyes up. Smile.**

That's it. Everything else builds on this.

---

## Three Levels of Action

### Personal (Now)
[**The Daily Practice →**](../practical/daily-practice.md)

One minute. Every day. Put your phone down, look at another human, smile.

This is the foundation. Without this, nothing else matters.

### Community (Ongoing)
[**Rebuilding "We" →**](rebuilding-we.md)

- Phone-free spaces
- Connection rituals
- Repair cafes and skill shares
- Mutual aid networks

Build integration infrastructure in your community.

### Systemic (When Ready)
[**System Change →**](system-change.md)

- Policy changes
- Economic alternatives
- Collective action
- The 3.5% rule

Change the systems that profit from extraction.

## The Key Insight

**We don't win by fighting extraction. We win by building integration until extraction becomes obsolete.**

Every act of genuine connection is an act of resistance.

Every phone put down is a vote for integration.

Every smile is a revolution.
